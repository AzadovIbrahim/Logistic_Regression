# Logistic_Regression
In this data science project, we explore the power of logistic regression analysis with Machine learning skills. Using a real-world dataset, we investigate how different factors such as outstanding Debt, the amount invested monthly, and monthly Balance can affect the individualâ€™s credit score. We start by cleaning and preprocessing the data, then perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships. Finally, we interpret the results and draw conclusions about the key factors that influence credit scores in a given bank. As we see the Gini score is higher than 40 percent then we can deploy the model to new data.
